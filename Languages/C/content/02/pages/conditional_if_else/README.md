<h2 align="right">What are conditionals ? </h2> 
<h3> Well, lets say that you need to choose between two shirts:</h3> 
<div> If the shirt is blue you will choose it, if not, you will choose none of these two. This is just a example of a use of conditional.</div>

<h2 align="center">The code of the conditional if and the conditional else in C</h2>
<h4>Since you understood the example that i put, lets make a code of it.</h4>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int age = 5;
int main() {
  printf("My age is:%d",age); // The output will be: My age is 5 
  // The %d keyword is for the int variables
  return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
