<h1>Variables</h1>
<h2>To assign a variable to a value we only need to use the equal keyword: = </h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre> 
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
// Here we comment just a line , the // keyword do this, but to comment two lines or more we need to use /* to start and */ to end the commentary.
// Said that i will explain with comments sometimes.

int age = 5; // Here we declare the variable called age that has the value 5
// The syntax is: first the type of the variable and after is the name/indentificator of the variable
</code>
</pre>
