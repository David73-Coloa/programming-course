<h1 align="center">Functions</h1>
<h2>Well, what are functions?</h2>
<p> 
Functions are ways to repeat routines without having to write them again or to return values that use another value, which are in function of other variables
</p>
<p>For example we have the sum function, it receives x and y as parameters and return the value of x + y</p>
